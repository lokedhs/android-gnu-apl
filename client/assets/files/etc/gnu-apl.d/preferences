# this file contains user preferences for GNU APL.
#
# It should live in:
#
# (1) in folder gnu-apl of the system configuration directory. or
# (2) in folder .gnu-apl in the user's home
#
# In both cases the file name should be 'preferences'
#
# The system configuration directory is usually /etc or /etc/local
# It can be overridden by  ./configure --sysconfdir=something-else
#
# If both files are present then (1) is read before (2) so that for
# duplicate settings in both files (2) prevails.
#
# Command line options take precedence over settings in any of these files.
#
# The initial content of this files contains all possible settings, but
# commented out. You should not remove lines but rather comment or
# uncomment them.

# OUTPUT COLORING
#
# Output coloring can cause problems when, for example:
#
# (a) you run GNU APL as script
# (b) you use a black background
# (c) you run GNU APL from emacs
# (d) you run GNU APL from a different terminal than color xterm
#
# In case (a) you should use the --script command line option and
# leave Color as is.
#
# In cases (b), (c), and (d) you can uncomment the 'Color No' line below.
# This only affects the initial state of output coloring; you can
# re-enable colors later with APL command ]XTERM ON.
#
# The corresponding command line options are --Color and --noColor
#
# If your terminal does not understand the ANSI escape sequences,
# or if you don't like to provide escape sequences, then you can set Color
# to "curses" and set color numbers instead of escape sequences below. This
# requires that certain environment variables (e.g. TERM) are set properly
# and that your terminfo database contains the terminal you use.
#
  Color         ANSI (default)
# Color 	CURSES
# Color 	No
#
# If you want to disable coloring initially, but switch to curses if the
# command ]COLOR (or the equivalent but now obsolete command ]XTERM)
# is given later on, then you can give the color command twice:
#
# Color 	CURSES
# Color 	No
#


###############################################################################
#
# OUTPUT COLOR ESCAPE SEQUENCES FOR ANSI TERMINALS
#
# Output coloring is implemented as follows:
#
# There are 4 output channels called CIN, COUT, CERR, and UERR
#
# CIN  is the echo of the input typed by the user,
# COUT is the normal output of the APL interpreter,
# CERR is additional error information, in particular logging.
# UERR is output of the APL interpreter cotaining error messages,
#
# CIN, COUT, and UERR appear on stdout while CERR appears on stderr.
# Normally stdout and stderr are both displayed on the same terminal,
# but output redirection in the shell can make a difference.
#
# When the interpreter changes from one output channel to another, for
# instance from CIN to COUT after the user has entered a line, then an
# escape sequence (actually, any short sequence of characters) is sent
# to the real output channel (i,e. stdout or stderr). The new channel
# determines which sequence is sent:
#
# CIN:   CIN-SEQUENCE  CLEAR-EOL
# COUT:  COUT-SEQUENCE CLEAR-EOL
# CERR:  CERR-SEQUENCE CLEAR-EOL
#UCERR:  UERR-SEQUENCE CLEAR-EOL
#
# In addition, when the interpreter exists, then a sequence
#
#	RESET-SEQUENCE CLEAR-EOL
#
# is sent which should set the colors to their initial state.
#
# The reason for sending CLEAR-EOL (i.e. clear to end of line) is to color
# the entire next line not only the chars printed on the next line.
#
# Unfortunately it is difficult, if not impossible, to read the current
# color setting from the terminal. Therefore the following is assumed:
#
# "GNU APL is started in a color xterm with white background".
#
# Color xterm is a VT100 (or ANSI) compatible terminal emulation.
# If this assumption is correct, then everything should be fine. Otherwise
# you may want to change the escape sequence sent to the terminal below.
# The numbers below are the decimal values of the bytes sent to the terminal;
# 27 is the escape character, for example. In order to change some or all
# sequences, uncomment the corresponding line and change the hex numbers
# (most likely the columns background and foreground).
# Each sequence can be up to 20 characters long.
#
# The default setting (i.e. for a white background) is this:
#
#               VT100:          foreground        background
#                               color    |        |    color
#                                        V        V 
# //                    ESC  [  0  ;  3 fg  ;  4 bg  m
# CIN-SEQUENCE           1b 5b 30 3b 33 30 3b 34 37 6d    // ESC [0;30;47m
# COUT-SEQUENCE          1b 5b 30 3b 33 30 3b 34 38 6d    // ESC [0;30;48m
# CERR-SEQUENCE          1b 5b 30 3b 33 35 3b 34 38 6d    // ESC [0;35;48m
# UERR-SEQUENCE          1b 5b 30 3b 33 35 3b 34 38 6d    // ESC [0;35;48m
# RESET-SEQUENCE         1b 5b 30 3b 33 38 3b 34 38 6d    // ESC [0;38;48m
# CLEAR-EOL-SEQUENCE     1b 5b 4B                         // ESC [K
#
# On a black background (still assuming VT100 so that the CLEAR-EOL-SEQUENCE
# does not need to be re-defined), the following may be more suitable:
#
# CIN-SEQUENCE           1b 5b 30 3b 33 32 3b 34 30 6d    // ESC [0;32;40m
# COUT-SEQUENCE          1b 5b 30 3b 33 37 3b 34 30 6d    // ESC [0;37;40m
# CERR-SEQUENCE          1b 5b 30 3b 33 31 3b 34 30 6d    // ESC [0;31;40m
# UERR-SEQUENCE          1b 5b 30 3b 33 31 3b 34 30 6d    // ESC [0;31;40m
# RESET-SEQUENCE         1b 5b 30 3b 33 37 3b 34 30 6d    // ESC [0;37;48m

#
# OUTPUT COLOR NUMBER FOR CURSES
#
# There is second way of specifying colors that uses the curses library.
# Instead of specifying the escape sequences sent to the terminal you
# only need to specify the colors wanted and curses will provide the escape
# sequences needed.
#
# Numbers for colors seem to be (nota bene: the author is color-blind):
#
# 0: black
# 1: blue
# 2: green
# 3: cyan
# 4: red
# 5: magenta
# 6: yellow
# 7: white
#
# The colors are specified as numbers like this:
#
# CIN-FOREGROUND  0
# CIN-BACKGROUND  7
# COUT-FOREGROUND 2
# COUT-BACKGROUND 7
# CERR-FOREGROUND 5
# CERR-BACKGROUND 8
# UERR-FOREGROUND 5
# UERR-BACKGROUND 8
#
# or, for dark background:
#
# CIN-FOREGROUND  2
# CIN-BACKGROUND  0
# COUT-FOREGROUND 7
# COUT-BACKGROUND 0
# CERR-FOREGROUND 5
# CERR-BACKGROUND 0
# UERR-FOREGROUND 5
# UERR-BACKGROUND 0
#
# Normally the two methods (escape sequences vs. color numbers) shall not
# be mixed. If they are mixed then the last entry in this file determines
# which method will be used. Also, the numbers for colors are different
# in both methods.

# SHARED VARIABLES

# If SharedVars are disabled then GNU APL starts a little faster and, of
# course, ⎕SVO and friends won't work.

# The corresponding command line options are --SV and --noSV

# LOGGING FACILITIES

# be used several times.
#
# See command ]LOG for available logging facilities
